## Authentication üîë

Passwords are no fun. NextTalk features a user authentication process managed by Firebase Authentication. The process works as follows:

1. **User Input**: The user enters their email (for login) or both email and username (for signup). The front-end initially sends the email/username to the back-end.

2. **Login Check**: If logging in, and an account does not exist with the given email, the back-end returns a redirect code, and the user is directed to the sign-up process. Otherwise, the back-end generates and returns a challenge token associated with the email.

3. **Send Login Email**: The front-end temporarily stores the challenge token in `localStorage` and uses the Firebase API to send a login email to the user. The login email includes a random code that the user must enter to verify their account.

4. **Verification**: Upon entering the verification code, the user is redirected to the home page of NextTalk. This redirect occurs on a URL hashed by Firebase, which the front-end parses to retrieve the user's profile.

5. **Token Exchange**: The front-end retrieves the challenge token from `localStorage` and returns it to the back-end along with the verified email. The back-end generates and returns a bearer token in the form of a cookie.

6. **Cleanup**: After being returned to the back-end, the challenge token is cleared from `localStorage`. The bearer token is set, and the user can fully access their profile!

This passwordless approach enhances user experience by simplifying the authentication process while ensuring security through Firebase Authentication.
